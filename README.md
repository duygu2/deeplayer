# deePlayer

Final year project.


Using mobile application development with Deepfake technology, it is possible to create an animation video with the image and video selected by the user through the mobile application. There are various Deepfake technologies in the literature. "First Order Model" is one of the Deepfake methods that combines artificial intelligence and image processing techniques, allowing users to create realistic animations by selecting images and videos. The developed mobile application enables users to select their own photos or videos and then create animated content using these media.
